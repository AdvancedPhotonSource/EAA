# Experiment Automation Agents (EAA)

## Installation

### Option 1: install via pip

First, create a conda environment with Python 3.11:
```
conda create -n eaa python=3.11
conda activate eaa
```

Then clone the respository to your hard drive. CD into the repository's 
root, and install it with
```
pip install -e .
```
The `-e` flag allows any changes made in the source code to immediately 
take effect without reinstallation when you import the package in Python.

### Option 2: install via uv

uv is a Python environment and package manager that is fast and dependency-deterministic, 
offering better reproducibility guarantee. Unlike a conda environment, a uv
virtual environment is installed at the root directory of a project instead of
in a centralized location, making it more portable. 

First, install uv using pip:
```
pip install uv
```

Then clone the repostiroy, CD into the respository's root, and create a new
environment there:
```
uv venv --python 3.11
```
This creates a new virtual environment in `./.venv`.

Activate the environment using
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Then install the dependencies using
```
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The `requirements.txt` in this repository is generated by uv on the developers'
side and contains all dependencies and their exact version numbers, thereby
maximizing the deterministicness of the installation. 

Finally, install the package itself:
```
uv pip install -e .
```

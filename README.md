# Experiment Automation Agents (EAA)

## Installation

### Option 1: install via pip

First, create a conda environment with Python 3.11:
```
conda create -n eaa python=3.11
conda activate eaa
```

Then clone the respository to your hard drive. CD into the repository's 
root, and install it with
```
pip install -e .
```
The `-e` flag allows any changes made in the source code to immediately 
take effect without reinstallation when you import the package in Python.

### Option 2: install via uv

uv is a Python environment and package manager that is fast and dependency-deterministic, 
offering better reproducibility guarantee. Unlike a conda environment, a uv
virtual environment is installed at the root directory of a project instead of
in a centralized location, making it more portable. 

First, install uv using pip:
```
pip install uv
```

Then clone the repostiroy, CD into the respository's root, and create a new
environment there:
```
uv venv --python 3.11
```
This creates a new virtual environment in `./.venv`.

Activate the environment using
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Then install the dependencies using
```
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The `requirements.txt` in this repository is generated by uv on the developers'
side and contains all dependencies and their exact version numbers, thereby
maximizing the deterministicness of the installation. 

Finally, install the package itself:
```
uv pip install -e .
```

## Quickstart guide

First, choose a task manager that contains the workflow you need. In this example,
we use `FeatureTrackingTaskManager` for a field-of-view search task.
```
from eaa.task_managers.imaging.feature_tracking import FeatureTrackingTaskManager
from eaa.api.llm_config import OpenAIConfig
```

This task manager needs an image acquisition tool. We use a simulated one:
```
from eaa.tools.imaging.acquisition import SimulatedAcquireImage
acquisition_tool = SimulatedAcquireImage(whole_image=<ndarray of simulation image>)
```

Create the task manager:
```
task_manager = FeatureTrackingTaskManager(
    llm_config=OpenAIConfig(
        model=<name of the model to use>,
        base_url=<base URL of the inference host>,
        api_key=<your API key>,
    ),
    tools=[acquisition_tool],
)
```
The model name, base URL and API key should be provided by the LLM provider.
The type of the object passed to `llm_config` determines the API to use. For
most LLM providers that offer an OpenAI-compatible API, `OpenAIConfig` will work.
AskSage is also supported through `AskSageConfig`, but there are currently some
limitations in the support.

With the task manager created, you can either run the workflow defined in the logic:
```
task_manager.run_fov_search(
    feature_description="the center of a Siemens star",
    y_range=(0, 600),
    x_range=(0, 600),
    fov_size=(200, 200),
    step_size=(200, 200),
)
```
or just start a chat with the agent:
```
task_manager.run_conversation()
```
The tool will be available during the chat, so you can still instruct it to perform
certain experiment tasks during the chat. 

To add an image to a message during the chat, append the image path to your message
as `<img path/to/img.png>`.

## WebUI

EAA has a webUI built with Chainlit. The webUI runs in a separate process,
and communicate with the agent process through a SQL database. Agent messages
are written into the database, which is polled by the webUI process and displayed;
user inputs in the webUI is also written into the database and read in the
agent process. 

To use this feature, specify the path of the SQL database to append or create
when creating the task manager by adding the following argument:
```
TaskManager(
    ...
    message_db_path="messages.db"
)
```
Then create a Python script `start_webui.py` with just the following two lines:
```
from eaa.gui.chat import *
set_message_db_path("messages.db")
```
Launch the webUI using
```
chainlit run start_webui.py
```
